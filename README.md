# Cloud Kitchen Platform

This project is a cloud kitchen platform designed to streamline the operations of cloud kitchens. It features a robust backend built with Django and a sleek, user-friendly frontend developed using React .

## Overview

The platform aims to provide a comprehensive solution for cloud kitchens, enabling efficient management of orders, menus, inventory, and customer interactions. The Django backend offers a solid, scalable foundation for handling business logic and data management, while the React frontend delivers an engaging and responsive user experience.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the Django project files and applications. This is where all the server-side logic, API endpoints, and database models are defined.
- `frontend/`: Houses the React application. This directory includes all the client-side code, components, and assets necessary for the frontend interface.

## Getting Started

3. Set up the database and apply migrations:

4. Start the Django development server:
